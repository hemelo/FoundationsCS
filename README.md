# ??? Foundations - Computing Pillars in C#

A repository dedicated to studying and implementing **Design Patterns** and **Algorithms & Data Structures** from scratch using **C#**.

---

## ?? About the Project

This project was created to deepen and practice the pillars of **software engineering** and **computer science**.  

The goal is not to create a production-ready library, but rather a **continuous learning space** where each concept is dissected, implemented, and tested to solidify knowledge.

Here you will find **clear and commented implementations** that serve as a personal reference guide and study portfolio.

---

## Main Objectives

- ?? **In-Depth Study**: Implement all 23 "GoF" (Gang of Four) design patterns and other relevant patterns.  
- ?? **Logic & Structure**: Build classic data structures and algorithms from scratch.  
- ? **Clean Code**: Write readable, well-documented C# code following best practices.  
- ?? **Validation**: Ensure each implementation comes with unit tests to verify its functionality.
